# balls_fate
A 3D game made with Unity/C# with unique game design and fully utilization of the Unity 3D engine and particle physics. 
The purpose of the game is to collect the barrels falling out of the sky to prevent them from colliding with the surface.
The player has to maintain a certain velocity throughout this activity, otherwise they lose energy which in turn depletes
the number of lives remaining.
