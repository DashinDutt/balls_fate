# balls_fate
A game made using Unity with gamelogic and 3D physics implementation scripted completely out of scratch. 
The purpose of the game is to collect the barrels falling out of the sky to prevent them from colliding with the surface.
The player has to maintain a certain velocity throughout this activity, otherwise they lose energy which in turn depletes
the number of lives remaining.
